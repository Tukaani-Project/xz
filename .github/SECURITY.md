# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates to all development branches and the current stable branch. Security updates apply to XZ Utils and our website at https://tukaani.org/xz.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it
privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives us time to work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

You may submit a report by emailing us at [xz@tukaani.org](mailto:xz@tukaani.org), or through [Security Advisories](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/security/advisories/new). While both options are available, we strongly encourage you to reach us by email. In any case, please provide a clear description of the vulnerability and its impact when contacting us.

This project is maintained by a team of volunteers on a reasonable-effort basis. As such, please give us at least 90 days to work on a fix before public exposure.
